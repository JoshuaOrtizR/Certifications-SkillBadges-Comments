## Teammates' Thoughts
> **From: Tricia Mansfield**
- **Position: Cyber Incident Response Analyst (RSM US - Seattle Office | 2025)**
  - Throughout the past year and a half, I’ve had the privilege of working closely with Joshua, and I can confidently say he exemplifies the core values of Caring, Curious, Collaborative, Courageous, and a Critical Thinker in every aspect of his work. He consistently keeps me informed about the latest vulnerabilities, often ahead of broader announcements, which reflects not only his technical expertise but also his strong sense of responsibility to others.

  - He responds to questions with clarity and timeliness, ensuring that communication remains seamless and productive. He regularly brings new ideas to the table that improve processes, and he’s not afraid to challenge the status quo when it leads to better outcomes. Most importantly, he fosters a true sense of partnership—I don’t feel like I’m working with his team; I feel like I’m part of it. His support, mindset, and approach to collaboration have made a lasting impact on how we work together and solve problems as a unit.
